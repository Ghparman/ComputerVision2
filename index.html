        <h2>1. Homography</h2>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>For this section I used ginput from Matplotlib to select my correspondences. It worked pretty well for this task with obvious visual landmarks between the two images. This worked well up until warping in Part 3</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-row">
            <img src="Images/Homography1.png" alt="Scene 1">

        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>This section was relatively simple but the most interesting thing I noticed was in Scene 1 with the sharper angle. In the original image you can see a reflection of what appears to be a door. This noise was pretty smoothly used in the final rectified image.</p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="document-scanner">
        <h2>2. Document Scanner</h2>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>For this section I originally tried to detect the paper itself using the edges of the paper based on the intensity change from the paper to the desk. I learned very quickly that the shadows make the transition from the paper to the desk much less apparent to the computer than it was to the human eye and went back to ginput.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Images/scanned_image.png" alt="Document scanner 2x2 matplotlib plot">
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>This worked ok, but you can see the issue comes down to the final aspect ratio of the image. When I scanned the document from the side, depending on how I chose the correspondences for the "top" and "bottom" the result would either be a long rectangle or a tall one. I could not find a solution that solved this without making the final image too stretched.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section id="mesh-vs-tps">
        <h2>3. Triangular Mesh vs Thin Plate Spline</h2>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>The major issue in this section was getting correspondences that made sense. With the different strokes, especially in the 7, it was extremely difficult to get correspondences that produced working results. 
            I initially tried with ginput and got some results that were ok, but never got one that worked for both the 3 and the 7.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Images/Failed_warp.png" alt="First 2x4 matplotlib plot">
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>I looked around for better ways to find correspondences for this use case and found skeletonization. It essentially finds what is actually part of the digit and applies correspondences within. This automates correspondences and guarantees that they will lie withing the digits themselves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Images/Failed_skeleton.png" alt="Second 2x4 matplotlib plot">
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>Even though when I visualized the correspondences for this they appeared to make sense, The final result still broke. I know the issue lies in the correspondences because in my multiple attempts at manually labeliing I managed to get some results that worked to an extent. Though I did not think to save these results.</p>
